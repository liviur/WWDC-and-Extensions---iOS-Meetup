# WWDC and Extensions - iOS TLV Meetup 2014

Here is a little git repository I opened just for the lecture that I gave during the iOS TLV Meetup held at 14/07/2014 at Afeka.

The lecture can be found as a pdf under the name *WWDC and Extentiosn.pdf*
Also the iBatman app is the app that was presented during the demo section.

I do not own any rights for the images nor the naming Batman in anyway.
If asked - this will be removed at once.
I make no profit whatsoever from using this though.
